# Cameron Fox

Hi! I'm Cameron, I'm a games developer and 2nd year computer science student at the Univeristy of Cambridge. My games, many game-jam entries and my Steam release Anchor Up, are released under "Orange Flag Studio". I am also the co-founder and co-president of the Cambridge University Game Development Society (CU-Devs), alongside Samuel Shakeshaft. I intend to update this page with games and programming projects that I do in between my studies.

### Game Jams & Highlights

I try and take part in as many game jams as possible - I started doing them in 2019 and have loved taking part in them since! I've so far submitted games for 19 of them. Below are some highlighted ones.

#### Some highlighted ones:

- [Trade Secrets](https://orange-flag.itch.io/trade-secrets) - Stealth-action / card-trading game with procedurally generated countries [CU-Devs vs Gamma 2/14]
- [Phoenix Fall](https://orange-flag.itch.io/phoenix-fall) - Gliding-descent game with procedurally generated levels [BTP Jam #3 - 152/1023]
- [Prisoners of Conscience](https://orange-flag.itch.io/prisoners-of-conscience) - Stylised stealth game with multiple endings depending on how the player behaves [Wowie Jam 3.0 200/972]

## Current Projects

### 3rd Person Cover System - Unreal Engine C++ [Continuing]

Standing bits of cover with transitions to/from crouch added. 

Planning to add: cover transitions and vaulting (and possible extension of the same system for climbing?). Would also be nice to make it into a bit more of a game! Obvious choice has to be some stealth game... Currently using a construction worker character so just need to come up with some post-apocalyptic context!

## Projects and Experience  

### Anchor Up
#### Trailer:
[![Anchor Up Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aNCixTz0mXI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNCixTz0mXI)  
[Anchor Up - Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384000/Anchor_Up/)  
Turn-based strategy puzzle game I independently made (art, code, etc...) in 15 months between April 2020 and August 2021, made in Unity (using C#). Implemented the Steam Cloud required file structure system in the saving of player progress, and the use of Steam Achievements. Responded to feedback received in the [Jonas Plays Your Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjy0-ewKuYk&t=1s) video in which the game was playtestsed, specifically updating the graphics for player movement and adding a realtime tutorial.

### First Person Puzzle Platformer for <ins>Epic Games</ins> - UEFN + Verse Group Project
#### Trailer:

At university, I led a group project where the client was Epic Games' technical director James Golding. The project was to experiment with checkpoints in interesting ways and implement this using UEFN and Verse. I created the game concept, overhauled the UI and wrote a custom inventory system to allow us to have game-specific items, something not currently extensible within the default Fortnite inventory and UI, as well as having an unbounded inventory size. I also handled all manipulation of the system, from collecting new items to handling selection with player input. I also created the state-previewer script for the location and object-reference floppy disks, which was used for displaying, in-world, the stored data of the currently held disk - this was later extended by team mates for the temporal floppy disk. The project brief did not require a fully playable experience, however I felt it was important to create a playable game in order to demonstrate why such checkpoints could be fun! I therefore designed and implemented all playable levels, 3D modelled and textured all custom assets, created any custom 2D assets and handled the publishing process.

### 3rd Person Cover System
#### Dev-log:
[![Cover System Devlog](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_-vrriGN1yU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_-vrriGN1yU)  
Using Unreal Engine 5 and C++, I implemented multi-segment cover rails as well as full wrap-around cover (e.g. moving around a box) with appropriate character rotation per segment. I controlled the cover animations using a blend-space within animation Blueprints, all other logic was wrote in C++. I wrote a custom component to make the creation process for new pieces of cover streamlined, new pieces could be created and dragged into the editor and would work straight away as demonstrated [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282817796915298304/).

### DNGN
#### Trailer:
[![DNGN Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/x7JMQEBYFqI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7JMQEBYFqI)  
[DNGN - Freshers Fair Build](https://cu-devs.itch.io/dngn-freshers-fair-ver)  
4 player gamepad dungeon crawler. Co-lead alongside Sam Shakeshaft. I designed the Enemy AI system such that enemies could use the same weapons as players and this would affect their behaviour. I also implemented the entire audio system, including the audio that was used, and the major gamelooping features (ensuring the resetting of game state and singletons on death). Learnt to handle Git merges on a larger scale than I had before.

### C++ Particle System  
#### Dev-log:
[![Particle System Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LH8dyr6qCl8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8dyr6qCl8)  
I completed the Sumo Digital C++ course using their one-line game engine. I then used the framework to create my own particle system, demonstrated in the video above. This was then reviewed by a developer at Sumo Digital who was able to provide valuable feedback about code efficiency improvements.

### Trade Secrets - Post Jam Expanded
#### Trailer:
[![Trade Secrets Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/eZCSa96XqB4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/eZCSa96XqB4)  
[Game Page - Play in Browser](https://orange-flag.itch.io/trade-secrets) 

For the Cambridge University Game Development Society (CU-Devs) vs the University of Hokkadio Game Development Society (Gamma) 48 hour game jam we hosted, the theme was *secrets*. My submission "Trade Secrets" was a stealth-action / card-trading game where the player infiltrates secret-service buildings to collect secrets and then trades these with other countries in order to have certain combinations of secrets which can be used to topple countries. The countries in each playthrough are procedurally generated and the player can face off against a custom set number of them. The levels are also semi-procedural with obstacles, secrets and their contents and the appearance of the room procedurally created from the information of the current country being visited. Some secrets allow players to visit other countries or trade with their leaders - the worth of secrets is also dynamic depending on who the trading-country is. The game placed 2nd in 3 categories including in "overall".

### 3rd Person Ledge-Climbing Character Controller
#### Trailer:
[![3rd Person Controller Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JsnFtw4QK7k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsnFtw4QK7k)  
Solo project where I created a 3rd person character controller and camera for a stealth game demo in Unity. The USP for the stealth game was the ability for the character to dash through walls, and also dash through enemies to kill them. The ledge climbing also implemented corner transitions and slope climbing.

### Photography Weather App  
#### Demonstration video:
[![3rd Person Controller Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3fuzVbWm56s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuzVbWm56s)  
Team project for the Interaction Design course. I implemented custom element animations, filtering-by-condition (e.g. if you wanted to take a rainy photo, it would show you the nearest locations where it is currently raining) and a tab system such that the weather-data pages could easily be swapped between by clicking the add button and then clicking on tabs at the bottom. Used React-Native. Taught me how to code web apps using hooks and events.

### GeoTIFF to 3D Model - Flat Route Planner
#### Demonstration video:
[![Route Planner Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OsSs4PIqN9k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsSs4PIqN9k)  
Created a GeoTIFF to 3D model generator. I then adapted the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the flattest routes, with a variable max-incline that the pathfinder will then try to adhere to. Taught me how to decode TIFF formatted data and the representation of 3D models at a lower level - something I have learnt much more about at university since.  

### Procedurally Generated Boss Fights
#### Demonstration video:
[![Procedural Boss Fights Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PD7mZSkJmu4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD7mZSkJmu4)  
Used a delegate function strategy for procedurally generating bosses. Movesets are generated at the start of the fight, each boss starts with a certain number of "points" which it then spends on moves or behaviours to add to its moveset, it also spends them on burst moves (e.g. dash three times in a row) and combinational moves (e.g. throw a bomb and jump). Upcoming moves affect the enemy's behaviour, such that if a ranged move is planned to happen next then the boss will try and create distance from the player.
