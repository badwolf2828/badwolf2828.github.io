# Cameron Fox

Hi! I'm Cameron, I'm a games developer and 2nd year computer science student at the Univeristy of Cambridge. My games, many game-jam entries and my Steam release Anchor Up, are released under "Orange Flag Studio". I am also the co-founder and co-president of the Cambridge University Game Development Society (CU-Devs), alongside Samuel Shakeshaft. I intend to update this page with games and programming projects that I do in between my studies.

### Anchor Up

[Anchor Up - Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384000/Anchor_Up/)  
Turn-based strategy puzzle game I independently made (art, code, etc...) in 15 months between April 2020 and August 2021, made in Unity (using C#). Implemented the Steam Cloud required file structure system in the saving of player progress, and the use of Steam Achievements. Responded to feedback received in the [Jonas Plays Your Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjy0-ewKuYk&t=1s) video in which the game was playtestsed, specifically updating the graphics for player movement and adding a realtime tutorial.

### DNGN

[DNGN - Fair Build](https://cu-devs.itch.io/dngn-freshers-fair-ver)  
4 player gamepad dungeon crawler. Co-lead alongside Sam Shakeshaft. I designed the Enemy AI system such that enemies could use the same weapons as players and this would affect their behaviour. I also implemented the entire audio system, including the audio that was used, and the major gamelooping features (ensuring the resetting of game state and singletons on death). Learnt to handle Git merges on a larger scale than I had before. Also using Unity C#.

### C++ Particle System  
[![Particle System Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LH8dyr6qCl8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8dyr6qCl8)  
I completed the Sumo Digital C++ course using their one-line game engine. I then used the framework to create my own particle system, demonstrated in the video above. This was then reviewed by a developer at Sumo Digital who was able to provide valuable feedback about code efficiency improvements.

### 3rd Person Ledge-Climbing Character Controller
[![3rd Person Controller Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JsnFtw4QK7k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsnFtw4QK7k)  
Solo project where I wrote created the logic for a 3rd person character controller and camera for a stealth game demo. The USP for the stealth game was the ability for the character to dash through walls, and also dash through enemies to kill them. The ledge climbing also implemented corner transitions and slope climbing.

### Photography Weather App  
[![3rd Person Controller Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3fuzVbWm56s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuzVbWm56s)  
Team project for the Interaction Design course. I implemented custom element animations, filtering-by-condition (e.g. if you wanted to take a rainy photo, it would show you the nearest locations where it is currently raining) and a tab system such that the weather-data pages could easily be swapped between by clicking the add button and then clicking on tabs at the bottom. Used React-Native.
