# Cameron Fox

Hi! I'm Cameron, I'm a games developer and 2nd year computer science student at the Univeristy of Cambridge. My games, many game-jam entries and my Steam release Anchor Up, are released under "Orange Flag Studio". I am also the co-founder and co-president of the Cambridge University Game Development Society (CU-Devs), alongside Samuel Shakeshaft. I intend to update this page with games and programming projects that I do in between my studies.

[Anchor Up - Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384000/Anchor_Up/)  
Turn-based strategy puzzle game I independently made (art, code, etc...) in 15 months between April 2020 and August 2021, made in Unity (using C#). Implemented the Steam Cloud required file structure system in the saving of player progress, and the use of Steam Achievements. Responded to feedback received in the [Jonas Plays Your Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjy0-ewKuYk&t=1s) video in which the game was playtestsed, specifically updating the graphics for player movement and adding a realtime tutorial.

### DNGN

[DNGN - Fair Build](https://cu-devs.itch.io/dngn-freshers-fair-ver)  
Co-lead alongside Sam Shakeshaft. I designed the Enemy AI system such that enemies could use the same weapons as players and this would affect their behaviour. I also implemented the entire audio system, including the audio that was used, and the major gamelooping features (ensuring the resetting of game state and singletons on death). Learnt to handle Git merges on a larger scale than I had before.
