# Cameron Fox

Hi! I'm Cameron, I'm a games developer and 2nd year computer science student at the Univeristy of Cambridge. My games, many game-jam entries and my Steam release Anchor Up, are released under "Orange Flag Studio". I am also the co-founder and co-president of the Cambridge University Game Development Society (CU-Devs), alongside Samuel Shakeshaft. I intend to update this page with games and programming projects that I do in between my studies.
